Advanced SQL: Checkpoint
1. 
select E.`First name`, E.`Last name`
from employees E, orders O 
where O.`Employee ID` = E.`ID` and O.`Ship State/Province` = 'CA';

2. 
select concat(E.`First Name`, ' ', E.`Last Name`) as `Employee Name`, O.`Ship City`
from employees E join orders O on E.ID = O.`Employee ID`
where O.`Ship State/Province` = 'CA';

Well, I'm still not really used to messing with from that much. But it does feel nice.
Although, honestly, doing multiple joins like on 5 made me a little nervous.

4. 
Original:
select C.`First Name`, C.`Last Name`, O.`Ship City`
from customers C, orders O 
where O.`Customer ID` = C.`ID` and O.`Ship State/Province` = 'CA';
Join Version:
select C.`First Name`, C.`Last Name`, O.`Ship City`
from customers C join orders O on O.`Customer ID` = C.`ID`
where O.`Ship State/Province` = 'CA';

5.
Original:
select concat(C.`First Name`, ' ', C.`Last Name`) as `Customer Name`, concat(E.`First name`, ' ', E.`Last name`) as `Employee Name`, O.`Ship City` as `Order Ship City`
from customers C, orders O, employees E
where O.`Customer ID` = C.`ID` and O.`Employee ID` = E.`ID` and O.`Ship State/Province` = 'CA';
Join Version:
select concat(C.`First Name`, ' ', C.`Last Name`) as `Customer Name`, concat(E.`First name`, ' ', E.`Last name`) as `Employee Name`, O.`Ship City`
from customers C join orders O on O.`Customer ID` = C.`ID` join employees E on O.`Employee ID` = E.`ID`
where O.`Ship State/Province` = 'CA';

Other joins: Checkpoint
1.
select OD.Quantity, P.`Product Name`, O.`Order Date`
from `Order Details` OD join products P on OD.`Product ID` = P.`ID` left outer join Orders O on O.`Order ID` = OD.`Order ID`
where P.Category = 'Sauces';

Well... I was looking out for sauces that had never been ordered!!! 
I can't tell if I did that right, or if there are any of those!

2. See 1

3. 
select O.`Ship City`, O.`Ship State/Province`, S.Company
from orders O right outer join shippers S 

So there's no order quantity column for shippers, right? Can I make one?
Can I use Count() to make my own pseudo-column somehow?
And how would I join it to the original command?
