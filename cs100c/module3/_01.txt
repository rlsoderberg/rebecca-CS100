Well, I'm still not really used to messing with from that much. But it does feel nice.
Although, honestly, doing multiple joins like on 5 made me a little nervous.

select OD.Quantity, P.`Product Name`, O.`Order Date`
from `Order Details` OD join products P on OD.`Product ID` = P.`ID` left outer join Orders O on O.`Order ID` = OD.`Order ID`
where P.Category = 'Sauces';

Well... I was looking out for sauces that had never been ordered!!! 
I can't tell if I did that right, or if there are any of those!

    select O.`Ship City`, O.`Ship State/Province`, S.Company, count(S.Company) as `ships per company`

    group by S.Company;
#

select O.`Ship City`, O.`Ship State/Province`, S.Company
from orders O right outer join shippers S on O.`shipper id`= S.id;

OK I tried doing group by but it's not quite working!!!
let me see if i can find it in further units...
oh, there's more in the same unit!!!
see, let me just wait a little before trying to do this...
like, i'm pretty sure i'm doing it wrong? counting and grouping by the same column? not sure how do it yet

1.
select O.`Ship City`, O.`Ship State/Province`, concat(E.`First Name`, ' ', E.`Last Name`) as `Employee Name`
from employees E join orders O on E.`ID` = O.`Employee ID`
where E.`Last Name` like 'C%'; 

2. 
select P.`Product Name`, O.`Ship City`, O.`Ship State/Province`
from products P left outer join (`order details` OD right outer join orders O on O.`Order ID` = OD.`Order ID`) on P.ID = OD.`Product ID`
where P.`Product Name` like '%dried%'; 

I had to check this against my previous version, turns out you don't need the parentheses at the very beginning
But I think it's a little less confusing that way
My problem was I forgot some backticks............

3. 
select P.`Product Name`
from products P
where P.ID not in (select OD.`Product ID` from `Order Details` OD);

ok, i'll finish this later!!!
