1. 
name: student table
schema
attributes: id(int), name(string), gradYear(int), major(string)

tuples
<34562, "Mop Stetley", 2024, "Textile & Apparel Studies">

<09736, "Cloud Porter", 2028, "Undecided">
<23098, "Fawn Dolby", 2024, "Precision Metal Working">

so for the third problem in this first section, i think you were referring to a project i didn't do
but i see last time i tried to do it with tic tac toe, which was pretty amusing
so let me try it with banjo, where i did use some external data

3. banjo data
probcount, questionList[probcount], correctAnswers[probCount], 
imageFilenames[probcount][optionCount], optionList[probcount][optionCount]

name: banjo table
schema
attributes: probCount(int)[primary key][foreign key to options table], question (string), correctAnswer(int)

name: option table
schema
attributes: probCount(int)[foreign key to banjo table], optionCount(int)[primary key], question(string), optionTxt(string)

tuples:
banjo table
<0, "We are on the lookout for", 3>
<1, "You have three griddles: a gas griddle, a wood griddle, and a coal griddle, but only one finger; which should you touch first?", 2>
<2. "What reads the psychedelic bulldozer?", 1>

option table
<0, 0, "magicians.png", "MAGICIANS">
<0, 1, "villagers.png", "VILLAGERS">
<0, 2, "demons.png", "DEMONS">
<1, 0, "gas.png", "THE GAS GRIDDLE">
<1, 1, "finger.png", "THE FINGER">
<1, 2, "wood.png", "THE WOOD GRIDDLE">
<2, 0, "crimsonking.png", "ALL HAIL THE CRIMSON KING">
<2, 1, "schizoidman.png", "ALL HAIL THE SCHIZOID MAN">
<2, 2, "moonchild.png", "ALL HAIL THE MOONCHILD">

i think last time i did this, i had a whole separate advising table
i'm going to try lumping it all into the teacher table this time
so is it ok to have two foreign keys???

oh, mysql is working!!! i am totally digging this tutorial, very comprehensive
the first problem in the tutorial is a pet table
first problems first!!! it doesn't want to load data local infile!!!

i mean, maybe i'll try to skip this and do more of the tutorial, or whatever 
oh, so timestampdiff is how you figure out death age of pets
like,  select name, birth, death, timestampdiff(year, birth, death) as age from pet order by age;
you can get curdate, and manipulate date with date_add
i honestly don't get the calc SELECT name, birth FROM pet WHERE MONTH(birth) = MOD(MONTH(CURDATE()), 12) + 1;
like, the way i know mod is the remainder of division
but that's apparently not this???
useful pattern matching with like and not like (% and _), and regexp_like (a bunch of other stuff)
other useful functions include count and max
ok, well, i guess the main thing i didn't get was local import, and i still don't get that
everything else is working, so i guess i'll go back to cs100...
