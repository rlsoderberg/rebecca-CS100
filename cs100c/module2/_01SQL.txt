well, in order to do any of this stuff, i need to use mysql
the command line client closes as soon as i enter the password
wish i could access it through the command prompt, but ???

oh, I had to go into services > properties > startup type: automatic, i think?

so... that's right! i have to use backticks for these annoying column names!

1. select `First name` from customers where `Job Title` = 'owner';
2. select `First name`, `Last name`, `Company` from customers where `Job Title` = 'owner';
3. select `Product Name`, `Standard Cost`, `List Price` from products where `List Price` < 20.00;
