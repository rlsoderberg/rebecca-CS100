well, in order to do any of this stuff, i need to use mysql
the command line client closes as soon as i enter the password
wish i could access it through the command prompt, but ???

oh, I had to go into services > properties > startup type: automatic, i think?

so... that's right! i have to use backticks for these annoying column names!

Checkpoint - Basic SQL
1. select `First name` from customers where `Job Title` = 'owner';
2. select `First name`, `Last name`, `Company` from customers where `Job Title` = 'owner';
3. select `Product Name`, `Standard Cost`, `List Price` from products where `List Price` < 20.00;

Checkpoint - More SQL
1. 
select E.`First name`, E.`Last name`
from employees E, orders O 
where O.`Employee ID` = E.`ID` and O.`Ship State/Province` = 'CA';
2.
select C.`First Name`, C.`Last Name`
from customers C, orders O 
where O.`Customer ID` = C.`ID` and O.`Ship State/Province` = 'CA';
3.
select concat(C.`First Name`, ' ', C.`Last Name`) as `Customer Name`, concat(E.`First name`, ' ', E.`Last name`) as `Employee Name`, O.`Ship City` as `Order Ship City`
from customers C, orders O, employees E
where O.`Customer ID` = C.`ID` and O.`Employee ID` = E.`ID` and O.`Ship State/Province` = 'CA';

Extensions to Select/Wrapping it up
1.
select distinct P.`Product Name`, OD.`Unit Price`
from products P, `Order Details` OD
where OD.`Product ID` = P.ID and OD.`Unit Price` > 25.00;
2.
select concat(C.`First Name`, ' ', C.`Last Name`) as `Customer Name`, C.`Job Title`, C.Company, C.City
from customers C
where C.`Job Title` != 'Owner' and C.city = 'Chicago';
3. 
select O.`Order Date`, S.Company, E.`Last Name`, E.City
from orders O, employees E, shippers S 
where O.`Shipper ID` = S.ID and E.`ID` = O.`Employee ID` and E.City = 'Redmond';
4.
select P.`Product Name`, P.Discontinued
from products P
where P.Category = 'Beverages' and P.Discontinued IS NOT NULL and P.Discontinued = 1;
5.
select concat(C.`First Name`, ' ', C.`Last Name`, '(', C.`Job Title`, ', ', C.Company, ')') as `Customer Info`
from customers C
where C.`Job Title` != 'Owner';
6.
select P.`Product Name`, P.`List Price`, P.Category
from products P
where P.`List Price` = SELECT MIN(`List Price`) FROM products;

well, this one isn't quite working!!!
