#well, look, i have to make some kind of file! i need to sleep on this hard!!!
#so i got the file to kind of work by converting it to ansi with notepad++
#anyway, so now, it's complaining about my syntax
#and why do people always write it in multiple lines? am i doing this right???
#well, i got to a point where it returned an empty set and now idk
#SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE 'Job Title' = 'Owner';

#reminder on how to get there, in case you forget
#cd bin
#mariadb -u root -p
#source C:\database\change.sql

#now, looking at the file opening... there are a LOT of errors, so that might be part of the problem
#idk tho. can i ask about this?


#also i need to figure out how to exit partially instead of using ctrl+c
