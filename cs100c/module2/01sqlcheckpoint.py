#so i got the file to kind of work by converting it to ansi with notepad++
#anyway, so now, it's complaining about my syntax
#and why do people always write it in multiple lines? am i doing this right???
#well, i got to a point where it returned an empty set and now idk

#now, looking at the file opening... there are a LOT of errors, so that might be part of the problem
#idk tho. can i ask about this?
