<!--i thought it would be fun to detect what browser the user was using
    apparently that's a whole thing called user agent sniffing!
    so i'm just using user agent strings?

    i'm having trouble finding the user agents!!!
    so i've got, like, two...
    
    what i'd really like to do, is randomize the responses. using... python???
    so i've never written javascript before
    i didn't end up copy pasting THAT much... well, i would have, if i could find more user agents

    well, it's almost working, except the detection doesn't actually work
    oh well! it will have to do for now!-->
