#this had better be the last time i restart!!!!!
#i do feel like i learn more trying to think of it by myself
#is this really necessary??? can't i just go out there and program and pick it up gradually that way???
#noooo, why am i so preoccupied with my learning being complete
#this is really actually pretty awful
#hopefully it gets faster and faster though
#oh, at the same time, i should probably practice typing properly
#ugh, i'm really not very into it though
#oh well here we go fine fine fine
#and don't expect me to get much done tonight because it is orchestra night!!!
print('Hello world.')
#i am already regretting this. i mean, why do i have to consume my time like this??? i need to get a job, ok???
#nOoOoOoO! i already renamed everything! whyyyy

#i'm going to take notes here on what things i wanted to ask about
#1. range??? are there any better alternatives???
#oh never mind, i don't have a lot of questions right now
