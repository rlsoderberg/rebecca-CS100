#well, i'm remaking the images every round, because it can't seem to find label1
#AND the buttons. like, what's the deal? how do i modify existing buttons?
#well, now the buttons are empty! what else am i supposed to do???

#i finally tried adressing them w.label1, but maybe i just have to put all my labels in here
#but then i also have to put layout in here! that seems like too much
#see, i can't set layout while i'm in game!!!

#the other option is, i could put all the get variables & set layout in banjo_ui
#but then i would have to re-import all the variables every round!!
#i guess that's not the WORST option... 
#well, then there would be basically nothing in this file, and this all would have been pointless
#fine!!!

#i'm not deleting this file yet, because i can't believe how pointless that was
